						EXISTING SYSTEM
Now a day many applications which offers online shopping of cloths. In those applications’ person can purchase cloths of different brands and styles. Today we find many applications of online shopping, as for example Koovs, Myntra, FabAlley, Voonik, and etc. In this application’s different brands, materials, size, color and other details are shown with the price of the clothes with attractive pictures. As for the requirements and choice of the person, he/she can buy the cloths. In all the application there is one feature by which customers can return the cloths (in case of problem in size or color, or if the product is defective) and in exchange customer can ask for refund or exchange with particular cloths. To attract the customers, they give different types of offers on different clothes with minimum charges. 

				    PROBLEM AND WEAKNESS OF CURRENT SYSTEM

Current application provides pictures of cloths, and he/she have to imagine his/her self in that cloths. But it is possible that after buying that cloths he/she may not like that cloths, in this case customers were unsatisfied. Current application does not provide look of any buyers in particular cloths and customers buy cloths by imaging themselves in that cloths after buying if the customer is unsatisfied, he/she is not able to do anything with that cloths. And in that case person lose interest in online shopping of cloths and prefer offline shopping.
